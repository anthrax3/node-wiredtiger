/*! @page compaction Compaction

The WT_SESSION::compact method can be used to compact btree and log-structured
merge tree data sources.

The data source does not have to be quiescent, compaction may be performed on a
live data source.

Because checkpoints named by the application are not discarded until explicitly
removed or replaced, they may prevent WT_SESSION::compact from accomplishing
anything.
