Last updated by Alexander Gorrod 23 May 2014. Probably out of date:

* Run test cases with Valgrind to ensure memory isn't leaking
* Implement an iterator API via the C++ extension
* Expose the iterator API as a Node stream (http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html)
* Add ability to rate throttle operations. At the moment it's trivial to
  overrun the WiredTiger async operation count max (4096).
