Last updated by Alexander Gorrod 23 May 2014. Probably out of date:

* Implement Connection close on shutdown
* Run test cases with Valgrind to ensure memory isn't leaking
* Implement an iterator API via the C++ extension
* Expose the iterator API as a Node stream (http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html)
* Document how the WiredTiger async callbacks tie into the Node/UV world view.
  It's not very standard.
* Move away from the Nan module - it doesn't help our code style.
